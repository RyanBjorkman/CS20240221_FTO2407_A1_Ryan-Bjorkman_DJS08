Question 1: Explain the Setup and Basic Configuration of React Router

Key Points to Cover:

What is the purpose of using React Router in a React application?

# React Router is used to create dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple views. It enables navigation without reloading the entire page, making the user experience seamless and efficient.

How do you set up React Router using BrowserRouter as shown in the lessons?

# The BrowserRouter component wraps your application and provides the routing context for navigation.
# In the App.jsx file, the app is wrapped in <BrowserRouter>, enabling routing capabilities across the app.

Describe the role of the <Routes> and <Route> components in defining the navigation structure.

# <Routes> acts as a container for all your defined routes.
# <Route> defines individual paths and their corresponding components. For example:

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
</Routes>

# Here, the root path (/) displays the Home component, while /about displays the About component.
 
Question 2: Application of Route Parameters and Nested Routes

Key Points to Cover:

Explain what route parameters are and how they are used in React Router, including the use of useParams() to access these parameters.

# Route parameters allow dynamic data to be passed through the URL. For example, /vans/:id can display a specific van's details. In React Router, you use useParams to access these parameters within a component.

Discuss the concept of nested routes as introduced in the lessons. What are nested routes, and how do they benefit the structure of a React application?

# Nested routes allow a hierarchical navigation structure, letting you define child routes under parent routes. They help in grouping related components and keeping your code organized. This structure benefits larger applications by improving maintainability.

Provide an example, such as the configuration for nested routes in the VanLife project.

# While I do not have any nested routes in this code, one could define /vans as a parent route and create a child route for individual van details /vans/:id

Question 3: Implementation of Navigation Controls and Dynamic Linking

Key Points to Cover:

How does the <Link> component enhance navigation within a React application?

# <Link> replaces traditional <a> tags, enabling navigation without a full page reload. This improves performance and preserves app state.

Describe the use of NavLink for active styling. What makes NavLink different from the basic Link component?

# <NavLink> is similar to <Link> but adds active styling to indicate the current route.
# Eg. When /about is active, the active class is applied for styling.

Discuss the use of search parameters and the useSearchParams hook to dynamically filter content, as seen in the VanLife project challenges.

# Search parameters allow filtering or sorting data dynamically via the URL, such as /vans?type=luxury.
# The useSearchParams hook lets you read and manipulate these parameters
# It is possible to use useSearchParams to dynamically filter vans by type in the /vans route.
